# Description of homework 1
1. Make a program that can find single word anagrams that use all the characters in a given string (e.g. “omnsotare” -> “astronomer”)
2. Adapt that program to find anagrams that use only a subset of characters.
3. Try optimizing the choice of anagrams to find the highest scoring one, rather than just the longest one.
