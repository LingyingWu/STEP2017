# Description of homework 1
1. Make a program that can find single word anagrams that use all the characters in a given string  
(e.g. “omnsotare” -> “astronomer”)
2. Adapt that program to find anagrams that use only a subset of characters.
3. Try optimizing the choice of anagrams to find the highest scoring one, rather than just the longest one.

This program is designed to solve the game [i can haz wordz](https://icanhazwordz.appspot.com).  
A lightly filtered version of the Debian American English [dictionary](https://github.com/LingyingWu/STEP2017/blob/master/week1/dictionary.words.txt) is used.
